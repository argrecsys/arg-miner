This repository contains a simple but efficient implementation of an argument-based recommender system, that makes use of the built taxonomy and lexicon to extract argument graphs from citizen proposals and debates of an e-participation platform. 

## Solutions
This system is made up of 2 major modules, which are:
- Argument Miner
- Argument-based Recommender System

## Resources
This project uses the two-level taxonomy of argument relations and the set of linguistic connectors (in English and Spanish) published in the <a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/connectors" target="_blank">argrecsys/connectors</a> repository.

## Outpus
All the results generated by the Argument Miner and Recommender System can be consulted in the following <a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/arg-miner/tree/main/results">folder</a>.

Example in JSON format of an argument extracted from a citizen proposal about public transportation by the Argument Miner.

```json
{
    "5717-1": {
        "proposalID": 5717,
        "sentence": "The use of public transport in the city is almost forced but in EMT pets are not allowed",
        "mainVerb": "is forced",
        "connector": {
            "value": "but", "intent": "attack",
            "category": "CONTRAST", "subCategory": "OPPOSITION"
        },
        "premise": {
            "entities": "[EMT]",
            "text": "in EMT pets are not allowed",
            "nouns": "[pets]"
        },
        "claim": {
            "entities": "[]",
            "text": "The use of public transport in the city is almost forced",
            "nouns": "[use, transport, city]"
        },
        "majorClaim": {
            "entities": "[]",
            "text": "Allowing pets on public transport",
            "nouns": "[pets, transport]"
        },
        "pattern": "P1 -> CLAIM + CONNECTOR + PREMISE"
    }
}
```
