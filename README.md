This repository contains a simple but efficient implementation of an argument-based recommender system, which makes use of NLP techniques and a taxonomy and lexicon of connectors to extract argument graphs from the proposals and citizen debates available in the <a href="https://decide.madrid.es/" target="_blank">Decide Madrid</a> e-participation platform.

This work was presented as a paper at <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2960/">Joint Workshop of the 3rd Edition of Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems (KaRS) and the 5th Edition of Recommendation in Complex Environments (ComplexRec)</a> co-located with 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2021). Virtual Event, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, September 25, 2021. Paper and presentation slides are <a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/arg-miner/tree/main/papers/recsys21">here</a>.

## Solution
This system is composed of 2 main modules, which are:
- Argument Miner: automatic argument extractor based on NLP techniques and a lexicon of connectors.
- Argument-based Recommender System: It makes recommendations of proposals and arguments based on topics and aspects of interest to the user.

## Resources
This project uses the two-level taxonomy of argument relations and the set of linguistic connectors (in English and Spanish) published in the <a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/connectors" target="_blank">argrecsys/connectors</a> repository.

## Preliminary Results
We present some statistics from a preliminary offline test on the automatic identification and extraction of arguments from the citizen proposals available in the Decide Madrid database:
- From the full list of 318 connectors in Spanish, 11,645 arguments are identified and extracted (9,676 from simple sentences and 1,969 from compound sentences).
- Arguments were automatically extracted as follows: 2025 in the proposals and 9620 in the proposal comments.
- Of the 11,645 arguments extracted (some proposals had more than one argument), 5,136 (44.1 %) were identified with connectors from the CONTRAST category, 4,669 (40.1 %) from the CONSEQUENCE category, 1,316 (11.3 %) from the CAUSE category, 505 (4.3 %) from the ELABORATION category, 
and 19 (0.2 %) from the CLARIFICATION category.

## Descriptive and Network Analysis
- The descriptive analysis of the result of the automatic annotation can be seen in the following <a href="https://argrecsys.github.io/arg-miner/analysis/DataAnalysis.html" target="_blank">report</a>.
- Network analysis to find the argumentative threads within the proposals can be seen in the following <a href="https://argrecsys.github.io/arg-miner/analysis/NetworkAnalysis.html" target="_blank">report</a>.

## Outputs
All the results generated by the Argument Miner and Recommender System can be consulted in the following <a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/arg-miner/tree/main/results">folder</a>.
